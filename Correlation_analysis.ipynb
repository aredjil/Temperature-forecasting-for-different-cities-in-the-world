    "## Temperature forecasting for different cities in the world\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "For this project you are asked to analyze three datasets, called respectively:\n",
    "1. pollution_us_2000_2016.csv\n",
    "2. greenhouse_gas_inventory_data_data.csv\n",
    "3. GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to extract from dataset 2 only the US countries (for which we have info in the other datasets) and to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "- to measure how pollution and temperature create cluster tracing the high populated cities in the world\n",
    "- to analyze the correlation between pollution data and temperature change.\n",
    "- to predict the yearly temperature change of a given city over a given time period, using the <b>ARIMA model</b> for <b>time series forecasting</b>, that is a model for time series forecasting integrating AR models with Moving Average.\n",
    "- (OPTIONAL) rank the 5 cities that will have a highest temperature change in US\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### TASK1 :Cluster Analysis\n",
    "You use K-means or DBSCAN to perform the cluster analysis, and create a new dataset where the cities are associated to the different identified clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "### TASK 2: Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "You measure the correlation between:\n",
    "- temperature and latitude\n",
    "- temperature and pollution\n",
    "- temperature change (difference between the average temperature measured over the last 3 years and the previous temperature) and pollution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### TASK 3: Predicting the Temperature of a Given City across a Specified Time Period\n",
    "After reading the data in the temperature data set, for each city cluster, before applying the ARIMA model you perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- EDA\n",
    "- data cleaning and preprocessing (Converting the 'dt' (date) column to DateTime format, removing NaN)\n",
    "- feature selection\n",
    "- make the time-series stationary\n",
    "- check for stationarity : Calculating the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test statistic \n",
    "- identify the (p, q) order of the ARIMA model using ACF partial autocorrelation plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "-fit the ARIMA model using the calculated p, q values.\n",
    "-calculate the MSE with respect to the true temp. measurements to estimate the performance of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: ARIMA models need the data to be stationary i.e. the data must not exhibit trend and/or seasonality. To identify and remove trend and seasonality, we can use\n",
    "- seasonal decomposition\n",
    "- differencing"
